Each student is assigned to one house (siblings are in the same house) and any house will gain points if a teacher sees good behavior/focus in one of the students in that house and the teacher can also choose how many house points their house gets (The value is usally ~1000-100000 points). House points can also be earned through events, with usally the top 4 gaing points. At the end of the school year Grade 6s will calculate the total amount of points in each house and the winning house will be anounced.</label>
